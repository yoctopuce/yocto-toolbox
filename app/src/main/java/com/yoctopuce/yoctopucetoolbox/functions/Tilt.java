/**
 * YTilt Class: Tilt function interface
 *
 * The YSensor class is the parent class for all Yoctopuce sensors. It can be
 * used to read the current value and unit of any sensor, read the min/max
 * value, configure autonomous recording frequency and access recorded data.
 * It also provide a function to register a callback invoked each time the
 * observed value changes, or at a predefined interval. Using this class rather
 * than a specific subclass makes it possible to create generic applications
 * that work with any Yoctopuce sensor, even those that do not yet exist.
 * Note: The YAnButton class is the only analog input which does not inherit
 * from YSensor.
