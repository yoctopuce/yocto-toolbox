 * YDataStream Class: Unformatted data sequence
 *
 * YDataStream objects represent bare recorded measure sequences,
 * exactly as found within the data logger present on Yoctopuce
 * sensors.
 *
 * In most cases, it is not necessary to use YDataStream objects
 * directly, as the YDataSet objects (returned by the
 * get_recordedData() method from sensors and the
 * get_dataSets() method from the data logger) provide
 * a more convenient interface.
